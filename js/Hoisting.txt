🔥 What is Hoisting?

Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope before execution.

Important:
It moves declarations, NOT initializations.

JavaScript internally does:

Memory Creation Phase (Compilation)

Execution Phase

During the memory phase, variables and functions are “hoisted”.

📦 1️⃣ Hoisting with var
console.log(a);
var a = 10;


Output:

undefined


Why?

Internally JS sees it like this:

var a;        // declaration hoisted
console.log(a);  // undefined
a = 10;       // initialization happens later


So:

var is hoisted

It is initialized with undefined

That’s why you don’t get an error.

📦 2️⃣ Hoisting with let and const
console.log(b);
let b = 20;


Output:

ReferenceError


Why?

Because let and const are hoisted BUT:

They are placed in something called the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

Meaning:
They exist in memory, but you cannot access them before initialization.

So this fails:

console.log(b); ❌
let b = 20;


But this works:

let b = 20;
console.log(b); ✅

🏆 Best Practice (Be Professional)

✔ Always declare variables at the top
✔ Prefer let and const
✔ Avoid relying on hoisting behavior
