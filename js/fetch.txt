We use fetch() when we want to send a request from JavaScript without reloading the page.
Here:

Browser doesn’t change page

JS asks server for data

Server responds

JS updates UI

| Situation               | What to Use                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Open a page             | Browser automatically sends GET |
| Submit form normally    | Browser sends POST              |
| Background data loading | fetch()                         |
| API calls               | fetch()                         |
| Without page reload     | fetch()                         |

💡 So the flow becomes:

Frontend (fetch) → sends request → Backend (Express route) → sends response → Frontend updates UI

That’s full-stack communication.

⚡ Important Correction

fetch() is frontend, yes.

But the request still goes to the server.
