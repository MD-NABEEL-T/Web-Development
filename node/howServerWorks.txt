// When you create a server, you are:
// Making a program that waits for requests and sends back responses.
// That’s it. No magic.

// 🔥 What makes something a server?

// A server must:
// Be running continuously
// Wait for incoming requests
// Send responses back

// 🏢 Think of it like an apartment building

// localhost = the building address
// port = apartment number

// 🌐 What happens if you type only:
// http://localhost
// By default, the browser tries:
// Port 80
// (Port 80 is the default HTTP port.)
// But your server is running on port 3000.

// So the browser knocks on door 80…
// But your server is waiting at door 3000.
// No answer.


✅ Case 1: Server IS running on port 3000

You run:

node server.js

Now your computer is:

Listening on port 3000 and waiting.

Then you open:

http://localhost:3000

// Here’s what happens step-by-step:

// Browser sends a request to:

// Computer: localhost

// Port: 3000

// Your Node server is already listening on that port.

// So it receives the request.

// This function runs:

// (req, res) => {
//    res.statusCode = 200
//    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
//    res.end('Threessh')
// }

// Browser receives response → shows:

// Threessh
// ✔️ Everything works.



So the correct logic is:

Server listens on 3000

Browser must send request to 3000

If ports don’t match → no connection

Think of it like calling someone:

If your friend’s phone number ends with 3000,
and you dial 5000,

The call won’t magically redirect. It just fails.
