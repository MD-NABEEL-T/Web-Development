here we have learnt to install express 

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser.
It is built on Chrome’s V8 engine and allows:


Reading & writing files

Creating servers

Handling requests

Managing databases

Running scripts from terminal


Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js that makes backend development easier.
Think like this:

Node.js = Engine
Express.js = Car body built on that engine

Node alone can create servers, but it becomes messy.
Express gives structure, simplicity, and clean routing.
